 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Implementation notes:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1.  If a VCL application fails to reach a point where a valid Screen object exists
      then the destructor chain for the message handler results in access violations
      when the inherited methods.

     One scenario where this occurs is if you have a unit that creates a message
      handler object in it's initialization but the project DPR does not contain
      any code.  Such as might be encountered when compiling a unit list to identify
      project unit dependencies, for example (running such an application is pointless
      but if you do you would expect nothing to happen, not crashes).

     Although this is an edge case, it can be very confusing (and worrying) when it
      occurs so we avoid it by only calling inherited for the BeforeDestruction method
      and Destroy destructor if a Screen object is actually assigned.

    //  thread, not the VCL thread, utterly defeating the purpose and causing lock-ups
